        <p>
          From inception, Teal Climate recognized the need to have security
          architected throughout the Teal Climate, climate management & account
          platform (CMAP) and our supporting services. Our customers share data
          to calculate their carbon footprint and expect their data to be kept
          secure and confidential. To that end, we have invested heavily in our
          platform to enable enterprise-grade security features and processes.
          With this, Teal Climate's security posture is guided and maintained by
          four (4) security principles as described further on this page:
        </p>
        <ol class="ml-[2vmax] flex list-decimal flex-col gap-3 font-bold">

          <li>Architect and develop for security and privacy</li>

          Shared security responsibility model (SSRM)
        </h1>
        <p>
          As a software as a service (SaaS) application hosted in amazon web
          services (AWS), we maintain a list of security responsibilities that
          are shared between AWS, Teal Climate, and Teal Climate’s customers. At
          a summary level those responsibilities are:
        </p>
        <ol class="ml-[2vmax] flex list-disc flex-col gap-3">
          <li>
            AWS is responsible for the physical data centers, networking,
            perimeter security, hardware configurations, and availability of the
            platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services provided to Teal Climate for
            use in the CMAP
          </li>
          <li>
            Teal Climate is responsible for security configurations including
            but not limited to data encryption at rest and in transit, network
            and firewall restrictions, and application, database, container, and
            infrastructure security.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teal Climate's customers are responsible for the proper use of and
            security access configurations in the CMAP. Other responsibilities
            include but are not limited to user setup and management, user
            access reviews, data quality, data classification standards,
            third-party integration setup, and, as applicable, the single
            sign-on (SSO) setup.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">
          Principle 1: provision and manage users with the principle of least
          privilege
        </h1>
        <ol class="ml-[2vmax] flex list-disc flex-col gap-3">
          <li>
            The security principle of "least privilege" is utilized across all
            Teal Climate systems. Access to platform code and data depends on
            the resource’s role, and production access by employees is
            particularly controlled and restricted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teal Climate utilizes privileged access management (PAM) to manage
            and audit access to production environments. Using PAM, developers
            must request access to a production environment and the request must
            be approved by Teal Climate’s engineering leadership. Once access is
            granted, the access duration is limited to a specific duration and
            activity logs are available for later review.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teal Climate reviews Teal Climate personnel access to all systems at
            least quarterly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers are responsible for reviewing access to their Teal Climate
            account following their own access review policies and procedures.
            Teal Climate resources with direct access to customer accounts are
            always shown in Teal Climate user manager screen, so customers have
            a full view of all users with access to their data.

          Principle 2: architect and develop for security and privacy

        </h1>
        <ol class="ml-[2vmax] flex list-disc flex-col gap-3">
          <li>
            The Teal Climate CMAP consists of a multi-tier, multi-tenant SaaS
            application hosted in AWS and is architected into four distinct
            tiers or layers: the highly protected database tier, API tier,
            front-end tier, and web browser (which is managed by the customer).
          </li>
          <li>
            Web application firewalls, security groups, access control lists,
            and other security detection and control mechanisms are deployed
            between layers to provide multiple layers of protection between the
            internet and database tier.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">Authentication</h1>
        <ol class="ml-[2vmax] flex list-disc flex-col gap-3">
          <li>
            Teal Climate supports identity provider (IdP) initiated SSO via the
            SAML protocol with IdPs such as okta, Microsoft, and ping.
          </li>
          <li>
            If SSO is not utilized, and username and password authentication is
            chosen instead, Teal Climate supports multi-factor authentication,
            and IP allows listing to enhance access control to the CMAP. In this
            configuration, passwords are hashed with bcrypt and salted.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">Data storage and backup</h1>

            Backups will always be encrypted using advanced encryption standard
