        <p><b>Retention.</b> We retain the personal information we receive as described in this privacy policy for as
          long as you use our services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our
          services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes,
          enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws. In some cases, rather than delete your personal
          information, we may de-identify or aggregate it and use it in compliance with the CCPA.</p>
        <p><b>Sales and sharing of personal information.</b> The CCPA defines “sale” as disclosing or making available
          personal information to a third-party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and “sharing”
          includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third-party for purposes of cross-context
          behavioral advertising. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for
          monetary compensation, we may “sell” or “share” the following categories of personal information: identifiers,
          internet and network activity information, and commercial information. We may disclose these categories to
          third-party advertising networks, analytics providers, and social networks for purposes of marketing and
          advertising and to improve and measure our ad campaigns. We do not sell or share sensitive personal
          information, nor do we sell or share personal information about individuals we know are under age sixteen
          (16).</p>
        <p><b>Privacy rights for California residents.</b> The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights
          regarding personal information. Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, California residents have the
          following rights with respect to their personal information:</p>
        <ol class="list-disc ml-[2vmax] flex flex-col gap-3">
          <li><b>Right to know.</b> You have the right to request: (i) the categories or personal information we
            collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (iii)
            our business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information; (iv) the
            categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information; and (v) a copy of the specific
            pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
          <li><b>Right to delete.</b> You have the right to request we delete personal information we have collected
            from you.</li>
          <li><b>Right to correct.</b> You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies in your personal
            information.</li>
          <li><b>Right to opt-out of sales and sharing.</b> You have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “sharing” of
            your personal information, as those terms are defined under the CCPA.</li>
          <li><b>Right to limit use and disclosure.</b> You have the right to limit the use and disclose of your
            sensitive personal information. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information beyond the purposes
            authorized by the CCPA; thus, this right is not available to California residents.</li>
          <li><b>Right to non-discrimination.</b> You have the right not to be subjected to discriminatory treatment for
            exercising any of the rights described in this section.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Submitting privacy requests.</b> California residents may exercise their CCPA privacy rights as set forth
          below:</p>
        <ol class="list-disc ml-[2vmax] flex flex-col gap-3">
          <li><b>Right to know, delete, and correct.</b> California residents may submit CCPA request to access/know,
            delete, and correct their personal information by emailing us at <a href="./contact.html"
              class="text-blue-500 underline">Info@tealclimate.com</a> or by contacting us as set forth in the “contact
            us” section below.</li>
          <li><b>Authorized agent.</b> Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a
            verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer
            request on behalf of your minor child. To authorize an agent, provide written authorization signed by you
            and your designated agent and contact us as set forth in <a href="./contact.html"
              class="text-blue-500 underline">“contact us”</a> below for additional instructions.</li>
          <li><b>Verification.</b> To protect your privacy, we will take steps to reasonably verify your identity before
            fulfilling your request. These steps may involve asking you to provide sufficient information that allows us
            to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized
            representative, or to answer questions regarding your account and use of our services. In some cases, we may
            request additional information to verify your identity, or where necessary to process your request. If we
            are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will
            explain the basis for the denial.</li>
          <li><b>Right to opt-out of sales and sharing.</b> To exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing”
            of your personal information, you may do so via our <a href="" class="text-blue-500 underline">cookie
              preference manager</a>. We will apply you opt out based upon the personal information in our records that
            is linked or reasonably linkable to the information provided in your request.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition, if we detect that your browser or device is transmitting an opt-out preference signal, such as
          the “global privacy control” or “GPC” signal, we will opt that browser or device out of cookies that result in
          a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information. If you come to our site or use our services from a
          different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt-out, or use an opt-out
          preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well. More information about GPC is available at: <a
