                Customer may procure subscription services, professional
                services, and Teal Climate’s other related products, services,
                and technologies under this agreement for its own account and on
                behalf of one or more customer affiliates only when explicitly
                noted on an order form associated with this agreement. The
                customer is responsible for the acts and omissions of the
                customer affiliates under any order form pursuant to which the
                customer affiliate receives the benefit of the subscription
                services but is not a signatory. Additionally, with Teal

                under this agreement pursuant to an order form executed by such

                Climate the fees set forth in the relevant order form in
                accordance with the terms therein (“fees”) and without refund,
                offset, reduction or deduction. Fees in any renewal term will be
                increased by 5% or may otherwise change as provided by Teal
                Climate upon at least sixty (60) days’ prior notice to the
                customer (which may be via email). Except as otherwise provided
                in the relevant order form, Teal Climate will issue annual
                invoices to customer during the term, and customer will pay all
                undisputed amounts set forth on any such invoice no later than
                thirty (30) days after the date of such invoice. During the

                the fees based on such use as necessary.

                <span class="underline">Payments.</span> Payments due to Teal

                check, wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
                account designated by Teal Climate or such other payment method
                mutually agreed by the parties. Except as otherwise provided on
                an order form, all payments are non-cancellable and
                non-refundable and neither party will have the right to set off,
                discount or otherwise reduce or refuse to pay any amounts
                specified or contracted for under this agreement. If customer
                fails to make any payment when due, late charges will accrue at
                the rate of 1.5% per month (for all non-disputed invoices) or,
                if lower, the highest rate permitted by applicable law and Teal
                Climate may suspend services until all payments are made in
                full. Customer will reimburse Teal Climate for all reasonable
                costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys’
                fees) in collecting any late payments or interest.

                excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of
                any kind imposed by any federal, state, multinational or local
                governmental regulatory authority on any amount payable by
                customer to Teal Climate hereunder, other than any taxes imposed
                on Teal Climate’s income. Without limiting the foregoing, if
                customer is required to deduct or withhold any taxes from the
                amounts payable to Teal Climate hereunder, customer will pay an
                additional amount, so that Teal Climate receives the amounts due
                to it hereunder in full, as if there were no withholding or
                deduction.

                not provide a purchase order number before the order form is
                executed, the omission of the purchase order number on a Teal
                Climate invoice will not constitute a valid reason for delayed
                payment. Purchase order numbers can be sent to
                info@tealclimate.com for inclusion on customer invoices.

                As used herein, “confidential information” means any information
                that one party (the “disclosing party”) provides to the other
                party (the “receiving party”) in connection with this agreement,

                the confidential information of the disclosing party except as
                necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its rights

                confidential information of customer in deidentified form for
                purposes of developing and deriving aggregate data. The

                confidential information of the disclosing party, except (i) to
                those employees, representatives, or contractors of the
                receiving party who have a bona fide need to know such
                confidential information to perform under this agreement and who
                are bound by written agreements with use and nondisclosure
                restrictions at least as protective as those set forth in this
                agreement, or (ii) as such disclosure may be required by the
                order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other
                governmental body, subject to the receiving party providing to
                the disclosing party reasonable written notice to allow the

                the disclosure.

                extent you are required to do so by the relevant entity to which
                you report. Any such disclosure must be subject to substantially
                similar confidentiality terms as are in this agreement. You are
                not otherwise permitted to reproduce or redistribute the
                nonpublic factors such as but not limited to in reports issued
                publicly, however, you may publicly state that nonpublic
                factors, and their general name/type, were used in your

                international organization for standardization (ISO) 27001

                of customer’s account (including, without limitation, authorized

                Teal Climate is not responsible for any customer materials which

                require any admission by the indemnified party, and does not
                place restrictions upon the indemnified party's business,

                the defense or settlement of any such claim at its own expense
                and with its own choice of counsel or, if the indemnifying party
                refuses to fulfill its obligation of defense, the indemnified
                party may defend itself and seek reimbursement from the
                indemnifying party.

                of its obligations under section 4 or, in the case of customer,
                section 2(b), would cause the other party irreparable harm and
                significant damages for which there may be no adequate remedy
                under law and that, in the event of such breach or threatened
                breach, the other party will have the right to seek immediate
                equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction,
                specific performance and any other relief that may be available
                from any court. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in
